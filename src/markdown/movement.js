## Getting Started

1. Install app and functions dependencies: \`npm i && npm i --prefix functions\` or \`yarn install && yarn install --cwd functions\`
1. Create \`src/config.js\` file that looks like so if it does not already exist:

   \`\`\`js
   const firebase = {
     // Config from Firebase console
   };

   // Overrides for for react-redux-firebase/redux-firestore config
   export const reduxFirebase = {};

   export default {
     env,
     firebase,
     reduxFirebase
   };
